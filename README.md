# Quiz Game (C++ Practice)

This is a basic Quiz Game project written in C++. It's great for beginners to understand how C++ programs are structured across multiple files, and how to compile and run them using the terminal.

##  Project Structure

- `main.cpp` — Main entry point of the program  
- `quiz.cpp` — Contains quiz logic  
- `leaderboard.cpp` — Manages leaderboard logic  
- `quiz.h` — Header for quiz-related functions  
- `leaderboard.h` — Header for leaderboard-related functions  
- `README.md` — This file


##  How to Compile

Use the `g++` compiler in the terminal to compile all `.cpp` files together. Make sure you're in the project directory.

```bash
g++ main.cpp quiz.cpp leaderboard.cpp -o quizgame.exe 

//This will generate an executable file named quizgame.exe.

./quizgame.exe
